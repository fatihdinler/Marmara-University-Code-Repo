The scope of this project covers the essential functionalities needed for dormitory management. Users can view and manage data, add new records, and update existing ones through the web interface. The project is built using Node.js for server-side logic, EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine for rendering dynamic views, and MSSQL as the relational database system for storing and managing data. Additionally, the system leverages stored procedures and triggers in the database to automate key operations.
